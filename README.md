# Simulating-Disease-Spread
Past project that simulates disease spread within a population represented via a list

A user will enter in the requested population size, disease spread distance, chance of infection, and chance of recovery
After this data is provided the script will print out the data for every "day" until every person has recovered.
The last line will include the peak infection day along with how many people were infected
